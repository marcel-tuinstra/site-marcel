about:
  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    I'm Marcel Tuinstra, a full-stack developer with a background in IT and a strong passion for building robust applications with clean architecture and polished UI.
    Over time, I've grown into full-stack roles, combining backend logic with intuitive frontends.
    I build with Vue/Nuxt on the frontend and Symfony on the backend.
    Outside of code, you’ll find me doing CrossFit, Hyrox, running or biking.
    I’m always creating, whether it’s software or personal challenges.
