about:
  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    I’m a developer with a background in IT and a strong passion for building robust fullstack applications with clean architecture and polished UI.
    Over time, I’ve naturally grown into fullstack roles, combining backend logic with intuitive frontends.
    Outside of code, you’ll find me doing CrossFit, Hyrox, running or biking.
    I’m always creating, whether it’s software or personal challenges.
