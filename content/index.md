# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Marcel â€” a fullstack developer focused on building clean, maintainable apps with modern frameworks like Nuxt, Vue, Symfony, and Tailwind. I enjoy crafting user-friendly interfaces backed by solid architecture.

## About {#about}

I'm a developer with a background in IT and a strong passion for building. Over time, I've naturally grown into fullstack roles, combining backend logic with polished frontends. Outside of code, youâ€™ll find me doing CrossFit, Hyrox, running or biking â€” always building something, in or out of the terminal.
