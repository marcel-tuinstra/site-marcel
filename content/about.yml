  Hi, I'm **Marcel Tuinstra**, a fullstack developer based in the Netherlands.
  I specialize in building modern web applications using frameworks like Nuxt, Vue, Symfony, and Tailwind CSS.
  With a background in IT and a strong focus on quality, I care deeply about how things work and how they feel to use.
  Over the years, I’ve naturally evolved into fullstack roles where backend logic meets frontend design.
  I enjoy crafting intuitive UIs and pairing them with clean, maintainable architecture.
  Whether I’m working on a personal project or collaborating with a team, I aim to ship thoughtful, resilient software.

  ### My Development Philosophy

  I believe great software starts with understanding the *why*.
  Who are we building for? What matters most to them? From there, I try to keep things simple, efficient, and elegant, both in code and in UI.
  I value small details, sensible defaults, and developer experience just as much as performance and UX.

  I enjoy working across the stack, but I have a particular love for frontend architecture, design systems, and smooth developer tooling.
  My go-to stack today includes Nuxt 3, Vue, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Symfony on the backend.
  These choices help me build with flexibility and maintainability in mind.

  ### What Keeps Me Going

  I’m most excited by constant improvement: in my tools, in my code, and in myself.
  I love the flow that comes with solving a tough UI challenge, testing UI with the public, or turning a vague idea into something real and interactive.
  There’s always something to refine, rethink, or learn.

  ### Outside of Tech

  When I’m not at the keyboard, you’ll probably find me training for CrossFit or Hyrox, biking, running, or just enjoying a quiet day.
  I also enjoy mentoring junior developers, helping teammates grow, or catching up with people over a good conversation, inside or outside of work.
